I'm the best in the world 🎉🏆🌎 at making high-quality, practical algorithms that make computers run efficiently.

As a result, I've brought the benefits of quantum supremacy 🧪✨🔬 to classical computers 💻🤔📱 by making fundamental computer science algorithms that were once considered impossible.

Most of them, if not all, are optimal within their classifications, so they'll never be obsoleted ⏳👑 for eternity.

It's just the beginning 🦾🤖🧠 and I'm always working 🚧🔩 on new algorithms.
