I'm a software performance specialist.

I'm building a set of fundamental algorithms and data structures that have optimal performance within each classification.

### PRNG

**A** | [8](https://github.com/wstaffordp/prng-a-8) | [16](https://github.com/wstaffordp/prng-a-16) | [32](https://github.com/wstaffordp/prng-a-32) | [64](https://github.com/wstaffordp/prng-a-64) | Extremely-fast, small-period, statistically-weak PRNGs.

### Search

**A** | [Sorted](https://github.com/wstaffordp/search-a-sorted) | [Unsorted](https://github.com/wstaffordp/search-a-unsorted) | Fast, non-interpolated searching algorithms that emulate quantum searching algorithms.

### Sort

**A** | [Stable](https://github.com/wstaffordp/sort-a-stable) | [Unstable](https://github.com/wstaffordp/sort-a-unstable) | Fast, in-place, non-auxiliary sorting algorithms that emulate quantum sorting algorithms.

**B** | In Progress | Fast, in-place, semi-auxiliary sorting algorithms that emulate quantum sorting algorithms.
